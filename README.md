Image quantization is the process of reducing the number of colors or shades of gray in a digital image. It is often used to reduce the size of an image file or to simplify an image for display on a device with a limited color palette, such as a computer monitor.

During quantization, the continuous range of color or gray values in an image is divided into a finite number of discrete values. For example, an 8-bit image can have 256 possible values per channel (red, green, and blue), while a 4-bit image can only have 16 possible values per channel.

Quantization can be done in various ways, such as uniform quantization, which divides the color range evenly, or non-uniform quantization, which assigns more values to important or frequently occurring colors.

Quantization can result in a loss of image quality, as the original smooth transitions between colors or shades of gray are replaced by abrupt transitions between discrete values. However, the degree of loss can be controlled by selecting the number of discrete values used for quantization.
